#Headloss across Flocculator

Calculates the headloss due to pressure difference across the coiled flocculator using the Darcyâ€“Weisbach equation.

```python
from aide_design.play import*

p1 = 253.1714 * u.kilogram / (u.m * u.s**2)
p2 = 235.9223 * u.kilogram / (u.m * u.s**2)

rho = 1000 * u.kilogram / u.meter**3
g = 9.81 * u.m/u.sec**2

headloss = (p2-p1)/(rho*g)

hfModel=((shearG**2)*vis*L/v/g).to(u.m)
#Basically, this follows from h = epsilon*theta/g
#epsilon is the energy dissipation rate, which was rewritten as viscosity*G^2
#L/v is the residence time, theta
#g is the gravitational acceleration
#shearG was calculated using the g_coil function from the floc_model code in aide design
```
